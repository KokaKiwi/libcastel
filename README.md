# Castel libraries

Please see the [official homepage](http://castel.github.com) for more informations.

## Compilation

You will need LLVM, Ragel, Lemon, Clang (or GCC) and CMake.

    $> git clone git@github.com:castel/libraries
    $> mkdir libraries/build
    $> cd libraries/build
    $> cmake ..
    $> make

The libraries will be generated in the `lib/` directory, and their headers will be in the `includes` directory.

## Libraries

### CastelParse

Contains the class allowing to convert a castel source code into an AST. Includes a lexer, a parser and AST headers.

### CastelRuntime

Contains the runtime primitives allowing to launch castel applications. An `extern C` API is available for internal purpose; you will not be able to use it in a C program because it still uses C++ features.
